> *A browser extension that removes X's "For You" tab faster than you can say "algorithmic timeline" — because sometimes the best recommendation algorithm is the DELETE button.*

####  What's This About?

Remember when Twitter was just a chronological timeline of your friends tweeting about their lunch? Pepperidge Farm remembers. And so do we.

It takes one look at that "For You" tab and says "This does not spark joy" — then **YEETS** it into the digital void where it belongs.

#### Why Would I Want This?

Great question! Here's why you might want to join the resistance against algorithmic timeline:

#### The "For You" Tab is Like That Friend Who...
- 🎪 Creates drama where none existed (looking at you, engagement algorithms)
- 🍿 Feeds you junk food instead of what you actually asked for
- 🎯 Thinks they know what you want better than you do (spoiler: they don't)

#### With This Extension, You Get:
- 🧘 Peace of mind (chronological timelines are zen)
- 🎯 Content you actually chose to see
- 🧠 Your sanity back (priceless)
