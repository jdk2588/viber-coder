# viber-coder

*Because coding should have good vibes, even when the AI is doing most of the work (and probably doing it better than us, but shhh...)*

## What is this thing?

This mono-repo is my collection of those moments. It's where ideas come to get built, not because they need to exist, but because building them teaches me something or scratches an itch I didn't know I had or  just my coping mechanism

## The Philosophy (or: Why This Exists)

No philosophy only YOLO ü§ü

This project embraces a few core principles:
- **Good vibes only**: Life's too short for hostile error messages and cryptic configuration files that make you question your life choices
- **Practical over perfect**: Ship working software, iterate fast, optimize for human happiness (and minimal therapy costs)
- **AI as a copilot, not a crutch**: Let the machines handle the boilerplate so we can focus on the interesting problems (like arguing about tabs vs spaces)

## Projects

### [remove-for-you-x](./remove-for-you-x)
- A browser extension that removes X's "For You" tab faster than you can say "algorithmic timeline" ‚Äî because sometimes the best recommendation algorithm is the DELETE button. üóëÔ∏è‚ú®
